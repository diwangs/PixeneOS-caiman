# PixeneOS for Pixel 9 Pro
This repository is a simple fork of pixincreate's PixeneOS for `caiman` (Pixel 9 Pro) instead of `bluejay`. The AVB custom key can be found in the [GitHub page](https://diwangs.github.io/PixeneOS-caiman).

This repository is actively maintained as I'm using the OS that comes from this repo in my daily driver phone.

Please refer to the original [repository](https://github.com/pixincreate/PixeneOS) for installation instruction and issue tracking!
